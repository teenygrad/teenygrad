# Week ending - 17/Aug/2025

## Sprint Goal

Compile a basic pytorch model to PTX and return a compiled module to pytorch.

### Tasks

1. Capture MLIR generated for a basic model by pytorch.
2. Using the example lower the e-graph to the same MLIR.
3. Compile the MLIR to binary.
4. Return compiled module to pytorch.

### Tech debt

- Shape tracked has been removed during this sprint, to take a step back and design a better shape tracking system.
- The API is not very ergonomic at the moment, will need to revisit once the whole thing works and I have a clearer idea of what the right traits and tructs are.
- Modify project to use error_stack as that is more ergonomic as it has good compatibility with thiserror and provides stack traces. With anyhow we lose the error type because it used a dyn.
- Moving to mixed precision has meant that there is less compile time safety. This needs to be revisited to see how we can gain leverage Rust for a more type safe graph API.
