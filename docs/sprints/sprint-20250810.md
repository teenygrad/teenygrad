# Week ending - 10/Aug/2025

## Sprint Goal

Get Qwen3 working on CPU using ndarray.

### Tasks

1. Qwen3 graph completed with safetensors.
2. Compiler to convert the graph to ndarray implementation.
3. Fix all the issues that arise.

### Tech debt

- Shape tracked has been removed during this sprint, to take a step back and design a better shape tracking system.
- The API is not very ergonomic at the moment, will need to revisit once the whole thing works and I have a clearer idea of what the right traits and tructs are.
- Modify project to use error_stack as that is more ergonomic as it has good compatibility with thiserror and provides stack traces. With anyhow we lose the error type because it used a dyn.
- Moving to mixed precision has meant that there is less compile time safety. This needs to be revisited to see how we can gain leverage Rust for a more type safe graph API.

### Sprint Review

- Good
  - Added basic compiler backend for pytorch
  - Investigated and added e-graphs as the IR for the compiler,
    they are flexible and have a high performance library for
    transformations in egg.
  - Created 6 week action plan for MVP of the torch compiler

- Bad
  - Qwen3 conversion to Rust hit a roadblock on what is the best way to implement vmap
    during graph acquistion time. Need to investigate how pytorch does it.

- Ugly
  - The original dev plan has had to be modified a lot as I have changed the goals
    of the project for the rest of the year.
