# Week ending - 20/Jul/2025

## Sprint Goal

Get basic examples working on CPU with ndarray based tensors.

### Tasks

1. Neural network graph representation.
2. Compile graphs to ndarray implementation.
3. Implement forward and backward passes with Adam optimizer.

### Tech debt

- Shape tracked has been removed during this sprint, to take a step back and design a better shape tracking system.

### Sprint Review

- Good

  - Good progress on representation of the computation graph, and getting neural networks,
    loss functions to build.
  - Overall architecture of the compiler and accelerator interface is coming together.

- Bad

  - Did not manage to complete the sprint goal of getting the simpler classifier working via ndarrays on the cpu.
  - My vision of a statically typed tensor library is more difficult than I originally envisioned. Primarly because to get a really strong statically typed API needs a LOT of generics. Using macros may help but the result is not going to look pretty. I need to have a good think about this.

- Ugly
