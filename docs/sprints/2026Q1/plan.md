# Q1 Plan

## BHAG

- Get Qwen3 compiled and working with pytorch using rustx based compiler.

## Objective 1: Establish Core Infrastructure for Triton Integration

Key Results:

- Complete Rust -> Triton -> PTX

## Objective 2: Build Essential Neural Network Primitives

- Implement all primitives required to compile pytorch Qwen3 model.

## Objective 3: Demonstrate End-to-End Model Execution

- Successfully load and run Qwen3-7B model weights in inference mode

## Objective 4: Benchmark against vLLM

- Benchmark against vLLM on a H100
