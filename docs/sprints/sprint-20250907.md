# Week ending - 07/Sep/2025

## Sprint Goal

Make progress on end-to-end compilation of vector addition on Blackwell. Try and get at least 25% of the tasks completed this sprint.

### Tasks

1. Capture fxgraph with enough details to perform type checking analysis on the egraph.
2. Write triton kernel for vector addition in rust.
3. Generate MLIR module for the fxgraph.
4. Compile module to PTX for Blackwell.
5. Cache the compiled PTX, and cubin for sm_120.
6. Launch kernel on call to forward.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.
- better error messages for invalid data from pytorch
