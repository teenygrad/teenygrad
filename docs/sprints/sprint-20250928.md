# Week ending - 28/Sep/2025

## Sprint Goal

- Add API for calling the rustx compiler with a kernel snippet.

### Tasks for MMVP

1. Add API for calling the rustx compiler with a kernel snippet.
2. Build basic vector add kernel using rustx for nvidia Hopper sm_89.
3. Add basic infra for running the kernel.
4. Run and test.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.
- better error messages for invalid data from pytorch
- centralise rustx compiler dependencies at the workspace level
- investigate the rust lints undefined cfgs in projects such as rustc_llvm
- llvm and triton should be pre-built and available via CI
- improve compilation speed now that the project is much bigger
