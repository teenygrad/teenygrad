# Week ending - 27/Jul/2025

## Sprint Goal

Get basic examples working on CPU with ndarray based tensors, and Qwen basically compiling.

### Tasks

1. Create compiler API that can be used with models, optimizers and loss functions.
2. Compile simple classifier to ndarray.
3. Basic compilation of Qwen 1.5B model.

### Tech debt

- Shape tracked has been removed during this sprint, to take a step back and design a better shape tracking system.
- Config clone: required because of safetenor lifetime issues and references, will revisit once everything works
- The API is not very ergonomic at the moment, will need to revisit once the whole thing works and I have a clearer idea of what the right traits and structs are.

### Sprint Review

- Good

  - Good progress on initializing the Qwen3 graph from safetensors.
  - Overall ndarray implementation may be 1-2 days delayed, but no major roadblocks yet.

- Bad

  - Sprint goals changed, as priority is Qwen3 and not the simple models. This is a good decision but still goal changing in the middle of sprint is an issue.

- Ugly
  - N/A
