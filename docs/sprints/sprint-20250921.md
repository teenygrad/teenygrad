# Week ending - 14/Sep/2025

## Sprint Goal

- Write triton DSL and kernel for vector addition in rust.

### Tasks for MMVP

1. Write triton DSL and kernel for vector addition in rust.
2. Generate MLIR module for the fxgraph.`
3. Compile module to PTX for Blackwell.
4. Cache the compiled PTX, and cubin for sm_120.
5. Launch kernel on call to forward.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.
- better error messages for invalid data from pytorch
