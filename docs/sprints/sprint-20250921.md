# Week ending - 14/Sep/2025

## Sprint Goal

- Get mrust compiler integrated into the project.

### Tasks for MMVP

1. Get mrust compiler building without the need for bootstrap.
2. Integrate mrust compiler into the project.
3. Add API for calling the mrust compiler with a kernel snippet.
4. Add triton module and integrate into mrust project.
5. Build basic vector add kernel using mrust for nvidia Hopper sm_89.
6. Add basic infra for running the kernel.
7. Run and test.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.
- better error messages for invalid data from pytorch
