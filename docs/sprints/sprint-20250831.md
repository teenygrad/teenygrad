# Week ending - 31/Aug/2025

## Sprint Goal

Make progress on end-to-end compilation of vector addition on Blackwell. Try and get at least 25% of the tasks completed this sprint.

### Tasks

1. Capture fxgraph with enough details to perform type checking analysis on the egraph.
2. Write triton kernel for vector addition in rust.
3. Generate MLIR module for the fxgraph.
4. Compile module to PTX for Blackwell.
5. Cache the compiled PTX, and cubin for sm_120.
6. Launch kernel on call to forward.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.

### Sprint Review

- Was sprint goal achieved?

No, the development is behind schedule. This was caused by a few different factors, first being a detour into other IR representations (i.e. TVM). The need to enhance the flatbuffers schema to send more type information across. Python is such a shit-show when writing API's (the wonderful method .to(*args, **kwargs) as an xample, which makes writing suitables IR's really difficult).

- Good
  - Flatbuffers schema is now more fit for purpose as the interface between pytorch and the compiler.
  - TVM IR schema has some really interesting ideas for future evolution of the IR.

- Bad
  - Tech debt is increasing because of the need cope with various sundry issues in converting the pytorch IR to Rust, which means a lot of code has been written that will need to be revisited.

- Ugly
  - Python.
