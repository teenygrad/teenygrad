# Week ending - 28/Sep/2025

## Sprint Goal

- Add API for calling the rustx compiler with a kernel snippet.

### Tasks for MMVP

1. Add API for calling the rustx compiler with a kernel snippet.
2. Build basic vector add kernel using rustx for nvidia Hopper sm_89.
3. Add basic infra for running the kernel.
4. Run and test.

### Tech debt

- egg lang schema is not fit for purpose due to being too generic, this needs to be changed.
- conversions from pytorch schema to our internal schema is not the way Rust does things, this needs to be revisited.
- better error messages for invalid data from pytorch
- centralise rustx compiler dependencies at the workspace level
- investigate the rust lints undefined cfgs in projects such as rustc_llvm
- llvm and triton should be pre-built and available via CI
- improve compilation speed now that the project is much bigger

### Sprint Review

- Was sprint goal achieved?
Yes, rust code sent to the rust compiler. Basic type inference works (although more complex code is causing some type issues). These will be investigated this sprint.

- Good
  - Rust compiler integrated.

- Bad
  - Need to use features which may change or be removed in the future as they are compiler internal (e.g. lang items)

- Ugly
  - Rust compiler uses nightly features which may not see daylight for a long time or ever.
