# Week ending - 13/Jul/2025

## Sprint Goal

Get basic examples working on CPU with ndarray based tensors.

### Tasks

1. Neural network graph representation.
2. Compile graphs to ndarray implementation.
3. Implement forward and backward passes with Adam optimizer.

### Tech debt

- Shape tracked has been removed during this sprint, to take a step back and  design a better shape tracking system.
